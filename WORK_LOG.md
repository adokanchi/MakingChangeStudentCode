It passes the one test case that's small enough to run in a reasonable amount of time, which I guess is the best I could reasonably expect from this approach. |
| Jan 27  | 12:00-12:15am |                                                            Trying to switch to an algorithm where I use dynamic programming to build up from smaller target values. i.e. I compute the number of ways to get to 1, 2, 3, etc. all the way to target. My current algorithm is correct for ordered sequences of coins, but the problem is designed around unordered sequences i.e. my algorithm considers 2+3 and 3+2 to be distinct ways of making change, which is incorrect. Not sure exactly how to fix this. |
| Jan 27  | 12:15-12:20am | Immediately realized how to fix this doubling up issue. All I have to do is populate the counts[] array using only the first coin, then incorporate ways to use the second coin, then the third, etc. So instead of going in order from 0 to target and trying to compute the right value at each step, I could go coin by coin computing the possibilities. This ensures that I always pick the coins in the same order (i.e. whatever order they are in the coins array), removing the double-counting issue. |
