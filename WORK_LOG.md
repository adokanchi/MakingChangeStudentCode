It passes the one test case that's small enough to run in a reasonable amount of time, which I guess is the best I could reasonably expect from this approach. |
| Jan 27  | 12:00-12:15am | Trying to switch to an algorithm where I use dynamic programming to build up from smaller target values. i.e. I compute the number of ways to get to 1, 2, 3, etc. all the way to target. My current algorithm is correct for ordered sequences of coins, but the problem is designed around unordered sequences i.e. my algorithm considers 2+3 and 3+2 to be distinct ways of making change, which is incorrect. Not sure exactly how to fix this. |
